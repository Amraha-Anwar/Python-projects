# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

# Write a program that doubles each element in a list of numbers. For example, if you start with this list:
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# You should end with this list:
# numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# SOLUTIONðŸ‘‡

def main():
    numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        e_at_current_index = numbers[i]
        numbers[i] = e_at_current_index * 2

    print(f"The doubles list is: {numbers} ")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
